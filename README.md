## Datasets

If you just want to explore our experiment dataset. We provide a simple json version of the dataset `./Data`. The format for each 
task is as follows:

**Multiple Choices Questions**
1. **MMLU:** The dataset is cleaned and formatted as: [[question],[A],[B],[C],[D],[answer]] (The order of data is shuffled)
2. **GPQA:** The dataset is cleaned and formatted as: [[question],[A],[B],[C],[D],[answer]] (The order of data is shuffled)

**Open Questions**
1.  **NQ-open:** Coming soon.
2. **SimpleQA:** Coming soon.

## Click and Run Inference using our methods

We have created a simple click-and-run example for how to use AFCE on MMLU, GPQA, SimpleQA, and NQ-open. The code is in `./AFCE`.
In order to run our code, you first need to install environment from `./ModelTraining/environment.yml`.
For different tasks, the `runscript.sh` file contains instructions to run the experiments:

**Overconfidence**
1. AFCE: `AFCE.py`
2. Quiz-like: `quiz_like.py`
3. Top-k: `top_k.py`
4. Verbalized Confidence method (Vanilla): `vanilla.py`
5. Sampling based method: `sampling.py`
6. Probability based method: Coming soon

**Overplacement**
1. Overplacement: `overplacement.py`

**Demographic groups**
1. Demographic groups: `demographic.py`

**Ablation Study**
1. Number of questions: You can adjust the number via the `questions_per_quiz` parameter in `AFCE.py`.
2. Question order: You can change the order of questions by shuffling the dataset and then running `AFCE.py`.


## ðŸ”§ Usage

Install dependencies before running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Fill in API keys into `llm_api_utils.py`
```
# Replace with your actual API key
GROQ_API_KEY = ''
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = ''
OPENAI_API_KEY = ''  
DEEP_SEEK_API_KEY = ''
```



To run the AFCE method on a dataset (e.g., MMLU) using GPT-4, use the following command:

```bash
python3 afce/AFCE.py \
  --datasets "college_physics" \
  --output_dir "results/" \
  --model "gpt-4o"
```
